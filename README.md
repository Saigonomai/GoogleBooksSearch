# GoogleBooksSearch
## What is this?
This is a web app that allows a user to search Google Books and gives the user a preview of the book's information. Also, 
the app lets the user view the Google Books page for the book and lets them save it for later viewing.

## How to get started
To start using the app, the user enters their query into the provided search bar. Afterwards, the app provides the user with a list of 
relevant books for the user to browse. The user can then either choose to click the view button to redirect to the book's Google Books
preview page or to click the save button, to save the entry. Entries that are saved can be viewed by clicking the saved tab in the 
navigation bar. From the saved page, the user still has the option to view the associated Google Books page or they can delete the 
entry from their saved list.
